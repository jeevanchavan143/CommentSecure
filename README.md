CommentSecure: YouTube Spam Comment Filtering using Ensemble Learning

YouTube has played a pivotal role as a vital social media platform for video sharing since its establishment. However, the platform's open nature exposes users to malicious intentions, such as the dissemination of malware and profanity, often manifesting in the comment section. Despite the presence of YouTube's built-in spam control tool, its efficacy falls short in addressing the dynamic landscape of malicious and spam content within comments.

In response to this challenge, our project conducts a comprehensive evaluation of top- performance classification techniques, with a focus on incorporating ensemble learning methods to fortify YouTube's comment moderation capabilities. Through a rigorous statistical analysis, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) emerge as statistically equivalent performers.

Building upon these findings and the power of ensemble learning, we introduce " CommentSecure" â€“ an innovative system designed to filter comments on YouTube in real- time. This system represents a cutting-edge solution, leveraging advanced classification techniques, including ensemble learning, to effectively identify and mitigate spam, profanity and malicious content within the dynamic comment environment of YouTube.
